This is a modified version of Martin Kaltenbrunner's TuioKinect (http://code.google.com/p/tuiokinect/). It uses OpenNI user-detection to automatically set the point-detection threshold.

You will need openFrameworks (github version, untested with 062) and the following addons:

ofxVectorMath
ofxThread
ofxOsc
ofxOpenCv
ofxOpenNI

Tested and compiled with Xcode, OSX 10.6.
